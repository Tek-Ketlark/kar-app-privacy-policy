# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** February 4, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how **[App Name]** (“we”, “our”, “us”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application (the “App”).

## 1) Information we collect

Depending on how you use the App, we may collect:

### A. Audio / Microphone (RECORD_AUDIO)
If you use features that require recording audio (for example, voice messages, voice notes, or voice input), the App will request access to your microphone. Audio is recorded **only when you actively use** the feature (for example, when you press a record button).
- We do not record audio in the background without your action.

### B. Location (ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION)
If you enable location-based features, the App may request access to your device location:
- **Approximate location** (coarse)
- **Precise location** (fine)

We use location only to provide location-related functionality in the App (for example, showing nearby results or improving location-based experience, depending on your features).

### C. Bluetooth (BLUETOOTH_SCAN, BLUETOOTH_CONNECT)
If you enable Bluetooth-related features, the App may request Bluetooth permissions to:
- scan for nearby Bluetooth devices
- connect to Bluetooth devices

We use Bluetooth access only to provide Bluetooth functionality inside the App (for example, discovering or connecting to supported devices).

### D. App diagnostics
We may collect technical information to keep the App working correctly, such as:
- crash reports and error logs
- device and OS information (model, version)
- app version and performance data

### E. Account / user-provided information (optional)
If the App allows accounts or user input, we may collect information you provide such as:
- name, email, phone number, or other profile details
- content you submit within the App

### F. Usage analytics (optional)
If enabled, we may collect basic usage events (for example, screens visited, feature usage) to improve the App.

## 2) How we use information
We use the collected information to:
- provide and operate the App and its features
- enable audio, location, and Bluetooth features when you choose to use them
- debug issues, prevent fraud, and improve stability and performance
- improve the App’s user experience and features
- comply with legal obligations

## 3) How we share information
We do not sell your personal data.

We may share information in these cases:
- **Service providers:** vendors that help us run the App (e.g., hosting, analytics, crash reporting). They process data on our behalf and under our instructions.
- **Legal requirements:** if required by law or to protect rights, safety, and security.
- **Business transfers:** if the App is involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale.

## 4) Data retention
We keep data only as long as needed to provide the App and for legitimate business purposes (such as troubleshooting and compliance), then delete or anonymize it where possible.

## 5) Permissions
The App may request device permissions to support features:

- **Internet (INTERNET):** required for network access and online features.
- **Microphone (RECORD_AUDIO):** required for voice/audio features.
- **Location (ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION / ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION):** required for location-based features.
- **Bluetooth (BLUETOOTH_SCAN / BLUETOOTH_CONNECT):** required for discovering and connecting to Bluetooth devices.

You can manage permissions in your device settings at any time. If you deny a permission, related features may not work.

## 6) Children’s privacy
The App is not intended for children under **13** (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us and we will delete it.

## 7) Security
We use reasonable administrative and technical measures to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## 8) Your choices
Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, update, or delete your information. You can also:
- revoke permissions (microphone, location, Bluetooth) via device settings
- stop using the App and uninstall it

## 9) Contact us
If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or data practices, contact:

- **Email:** [tek@ketlark.com]  
- **Developer / Company:** [Ketlark]  

## 10) Changes to this policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the “Last updated” date and may notify you in the App if changes are material.
